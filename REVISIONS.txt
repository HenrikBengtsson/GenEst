Revision log

v1.2.0

* updated the .zip download buttons to no longer require an unzip utility to
be in the path statement in Windows. 

* more robust error-checking and more informative error messages. Changes
affect especially the functions under the "Mortality Estimation" in the GUI, 
which have the most demanding data formatting requirements.

* removed the requirement that GUI users both enter a value for fixedK and
check a box indicating that a value is entered. User simply enters a value
for fixedK or leaves the field blank, whichever is appropriate for the 
desired analysis.

* corrected the mortality splits results summary table to sort mortality
quantiles numerically rather than alphabetically.

v1.1.3

* improved error-checking and error messages for auto-parsing of CO, SS, and
DWP files to find unit column when not provided by user in arg list to
estg or estM. The error-checking is extracted into a short function that is 
called by estg and estM when necessary.

2018.11.22
v1.1.2

* example data sets can now be loaded directly into the GUI from buttons on
the (newly named "Example Data" tab...formerly "Downloads") rather than
requiring that they be first downloaded as .csv files and then uploaded
one by one into the GUI. (The data sets can still be downloaded for use
as input file templates or other purposes if desired.)

* improved error-checking and error messages for estM function

* export the more informative estM error messages from command line function
to the GUI

* updated links to User Guide and technical manual to point to doi's rather
than pdf's

2018.11.19
v1.1.1

* estg: error-check added for carcasses discovered before searches begin

* estM: error-check added for CO units not included in DWP

* cpm0: sample size was missing from cp model tables when s parameter has an
additive model (e.g., s ~ A + B). Fixed

2018.11.14
v1.1.0

* added links to published GenEst User Guide and GenEst Statistical Models

* corrected a GUI bug that prevented mortality estimation when CO and DWP files
had more than one column name in common

* corrected a GUI bug that caused intermittent failure to update some results
figs when user selected new models. The bug was caused by figs sometimes not
being properly suspended when hidden.

* corrected a bug that caused ppersist to return NaN or 0 for Weibull 
distributed persistence times when the variance of the scale parameter was very
large. The error occured when all CP field trial carcasses were removed in the
span of two intervals. Improved error-checking and an updated calculation of 
Weibull ppersist for data that generates fits with very large uncertainty in
scale parameter.

* corrected a GUI bug that erroneously allowed the drop-down selection menus for
mortality splits to permit more than two covariates to be selected in certain
cases where an improper model was first entered, later corrected, and then a 
third covariate selected from the temporal splits menu. Results figures and 
tables would show the proper covariates, but they would not be properly 
reflected in the drop-downs. This was due to an error in the conditionals for
the drop-down lists not being properly updated. It had no effect on calculations
or results.

* GUI code was revised for readability and easier maintenance: some groups of
very small functions were consolidated into larger functions, overly long 
variable names were shortened, some groups of short files were consolidated into
longer files. 

* Documentation for GUI code was updated to facilitate code maintenance.
